We  developing a predictive model for wildfires using artificial intelligence ( machine learning ) techniques to analyze historical weather  data to identify areas at risk of fire outbreaks. The model will be developed using the Python , The ML models that used :
- Logistic Regression 
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest 
- Decision Tree
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
